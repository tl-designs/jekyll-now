  A little over a year ago, I went to my current acupuncturist for the first time, sat down, and told her that I thought my work was killing me. That’s me being a little dramatic. What I really meant was to discuss the effects of being a full time massage therapist and having to sit at a desk for school. At that point, I could barely get through a week of work without laying flat on the floor in sheer pain. My muscles were strained, my posture wasn’t great, and it radiated throughout my body day in and day out while I constantly wondered how I would keep this up for years to come. Here are some wellness rituals I incorporated into my weekly routine.

  1. Yoga
  2. Take A Break From The Computer 
  3. Diffuse Essential Oils
  4. Work Smarter Not Harder At Work
  5. Get A Massage and Acupuncture Regularly
